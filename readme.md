# Azure Devops Date Badge - Chrome/Edge browser extension

Extension will need to be [side loaded](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/extension-sideloading) into your browser. 


## Configuration

Toggle the extension so that it can be shown on the toolbar, then click on it to reveal the settings dialog.

NOTE: The default setting is for world date format, so if you have US dates going on in your DEVOPS you will probably want to change this straight away.
